Good Morning.
The main code is in the main.cpp file.
The object file of the main.cpp is also included.
We can compile the code in linux as follows :-

$ g++ main.cpp -o main 
$ ./main create example.csv final.bin
where example.csv and final.bin are just examples.
Note - Please add the csv file in the same directory as the folder where main.cpp resides.
